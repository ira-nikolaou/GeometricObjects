# GeometricObjects
Exercise with focus on encapsulation and abstraction.

Start this programme with the file MainW3.java

The programme lets users create a list of 5 shapes with a circular base (Cylinder or Cone) and optionally define the radius and height of each. Afterwards, the user will see the surface area of all shapes and a list of the shapes sorted by size. 


Alternatively: 
Start the programme with MainW1: 
Makes a cone and a cylinder (of whatever radius, height you wish) and reports back on their volume and surface area. Also shows setting and getting of colour. 

Start the programme with MainW2: 
Creates two shapes and compares the shapes based on their surface area. 

Start the programme with MainW3Short: 
This version allows you to see the sort and compare to functionality without manually adding 5 shapes.
