# GeometricObjects
Exercise with focus on encapsulation and abstraction.

Start this programme with the file MainW3.java

The programme lets users create a list of 5 shapes with a circular base (Cylinder or Cone) and optionally define the radius and height of each. Afterwards, the user will see the surface area of all shapes and a list of the shapes sorted by size.
